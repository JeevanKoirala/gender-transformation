First of all guys >>
why did this took so long to be made:
SO the main reason is my potato pc and lack of knowledge guys I started off by trying the styleGan first then it didnt worked with that least amount of knowledge i had.
after that i tried the starGan which was trained on celeba but that thing didnt worked on my system dont know why it wasn't giving an output that was presentable.
and after all that mess i started from the beggining and made it through the gfpgan which was not mainly trained for the gendertransformation work but it could give me result that can be showed off to you guys and show what i was doing in the mean time.
conclusion: this project can be considered as a failed project but i wanted to show you guys what i was trying to make..

TO check this on your system you guys and copy my code and download the gfpGan pretrained model from the github the specific gfpganpretrained model with the .pth is down there.. you need to scroll down a little bit to quick interface and down there you will find the file to download.. other necessary things will be downloaded itself by the code...
consider keeping the .pth file outside of the weights folder otherwise you need to specify the path of the model...
you guys can also modify the code and use other powerful models for the gender transformation task like stargan..

Sorry for that guys i wasn't able to fully make this project because of lack of resources but this was the prototype...
and i dont want to show my face that's why i have blurred the video bit but you guys can see the difference clearly there..
If any issue arises while using my project you guys can dm me in slack i will be available there in my free time i will make it work...
thanks for reading this far..have a nice day
